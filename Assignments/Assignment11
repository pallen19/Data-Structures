Assignment 11 – PART 1 DFS _____________ (100 points) :
There is only one Part to this assignment, Programming Exercise 28.3 from the Liang textbook, end of the Chapter Programming Exercises, re-printed below.
Implement Depth First Search (DFS) using a stack. The depth-first search algorithm described in Listing 28.8 uses recursion. Design a new algorithm without using recursion. First, describe it using pseudocode and copy that pseudocode into the assignment submittal. Next, implement it by defining a new class named UnweightedGraphWithNonrecursiveDFS that extends UnweightedGraph and overrides the [Depth First Search] dfs method.
ISSUE – give them graph data and tell them they can hard code the data
ISSUE – to override a method they have to sift thru book code and figure out how to do it – they were not overriding method correctly
ISSUE there are dependences – the DFAS method returns a tree
ISSUE - UnweightedGraph extends AbstractGraph (which is where DFS method is found).
DFS returns a tree in the nestedclass.java – because you are supposed to return a tree you must look thru the constructor and figure out what parameters are needed and how to create the method. To properly override the method, it is not enough to print the search order.
NOTE: when you review Listing 28.8 you will notice that there are two dfs methods. You need to override the method dfs(int v), not the other one with the longer list of parameters.
Do not forget to include author header in each submitted file as shown, no header, no points!

Capture a READABLE screenshot(s) of your program output and paste into a word/pdf document. Readable means readable! Screenshots should not be an entire desktop – use some type of snipping tool. After your output screenshots, copy and paste the pseudo code, and then the source code for your program into the word/pdf doc. Save doc as a file named
  
LastName-A11-Part-1-DFS.docx or .pdf. Last step is to upload word/pdf and .java files to D2L. SUBMIT YOUR OWN CODE – Code copied from the internet will receive a score of zero.
MAKE SURE YOUR CODE HAS COMMENTS ! We are getting submissions without comments in the code. No comments = ( -20 ) points per Part of the assignment
