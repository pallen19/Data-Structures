Recursion

Objective: To reinforce the concept of recursion.
Assignment: There are two parts to this assignment.
Part 1 - Factorial
Write out the logic / pseudo code to compute the factorial of n, customarily denoted as n! It is important to use correct recursion terminology in your pseudo code.
Next, use your pseudo code as the basis for writing a complete, well documented program. Your program should prompt the user to enter a nonnegative number and then display the factorial for that number. Your program must contain a function called factorial. Function factorial calculates the factorial of a number. Sample output is included below.
Do not forget to include author header in your file as shown, no header, no points!
 
Enter a nonnegative integer: 4 <enter> Factorial of 4 is 24

DELIVERABLE INSTRUCTIONS
Capture a READABLE screenshot(s) of your program output and paste into a word/pdf document. Readable means readable! Screenshots should not be an entire desktop – use some type of snipping tool. After your output screenshots, copy and paste the source code for your program into the word/pdf doc. Save doc as a file named LastName-A2-Part-1-Factorial.docx or .pdf. word. Last step is to upload everything to D2L, word/pdf doc and source code file.
